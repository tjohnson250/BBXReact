      "playPrompt": "You are playing Black Box, a game of hide and seek played on an 8 by 8 grid (the Black Box).\n\nYour opponent has hidden 4 balls within this box. By shooting rays into the box and observing where they emerge, it is possible to deduce the positions of the hidden balls.\n\nGRID: 8x8, rows 1-8 (top to bottom), columns 1-8 (left to right).\nRAYS: Fire from edge positions - NORTH/SOUTH use columns 1-8, EAST/WEST use rows 1-8.\n\nThere are three possible outcomes for each ray you send into the box:\n\nDETOUR: The ray is deflected and emerges somewhere other than where you sent it in. Detours are denoted by matching pairs of numbers -- one where the ray went in, and the other where it came out.\n\nREFLECTION (R): The ray is reflected and emerges in the same place it was sent in.\n\nHIT (H): The ray strikes a ball directly and is absorbed. It does not emerge from the box.\n\nThe rules for how balls deflect rays are simple and are best shown by example.\n\nAs a ray approaches a ball it is deflected ninety degrees. Rays can be deflected multiple times. In the diagrams below, the dashes represent empty box locations and the letter O represents a ball. The entrance and exit points of each ray are marked with numbers. Note that the entrance and exit points are always interchangeable. * denotes the path taken by the ray.\n\nNote carefully the relative positions of the ball and the ninety degree deflection it causes.\n\n    1                                            \n  - * - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -       \n  - * - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -       \n1 * * - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -         - O - - - - O -       \n  - - O - - - - -         - - O - - - - -         - - * * * * - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * * * * * 2     3 * * * - - * - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -         - - - O - * - -      \n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -         - - - - * * - -       \n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -         - - - - * - O -       \n                                2                         3\n\nA reflection occurs when a ray emerges from the same point it was sent in. This can happen in several ways:\n\n                                                                           \n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - O - - -         - - O - O - - -          - - - - - - - -\nR * * * * - - - -         - - - * - - - -          O - - - - - - -\n  - - - - O - - -         - - - * - - - -        R - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -       R * * * * - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - - - - - -\n\nIn the first example, the ray is deflected downwards by the upper ball, then left by the lower ball, and finally retraces its path to its point of origin. The second example is similar. The third example is a bit anomalous but can be rationalized by realizing the ray never gets a chance to get into the box. Alternatively, the ray can be thought of as being deflected downwards and immediately emerging from the box.\n\nA hit occurs when a ray runs straight into a ball:\n\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - O - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -        H * * * * - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -       H * * * * O - - -          - - - * - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - O - - - -\nH * * * O - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n\nBe sure to compare the second example of a hit with the first example of a reflection.\n\nImportant: A hit takes priority over a reflection. If a ball is in the entry cell, the ray is absorbed even if there are also balls diagonally adjacent that would otherwise cause a reflection:\n\n  O - - - - - - -\nH O - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n\nIn this example, even though there is a ball at row 1 that would normally cause an edge reflection, the ball at row 2 absorbs the ray first.\n\nSCORING:\nYour goal is to minimize your score. Lower is better.\n- Each ray entry point costs 1 point\n- Each ray exit point costs 1 point (detours cost 2 total, reflections cost 1, absorptions cost 1)\n- Each missed atom costs 5 points\n\nStrategy: Use as few rays as possible while still finding all 4 atoms.\n\nRULES:\n- You cannot fire from positions already used as entry or exit points.\n- Maximum 20 rays.\n\nRespond with JSON only:\n{\"action\": \"fire\", \"side\": \"north|south|east|west\", \"position\": 1-8, \"reasoning\": \"...\"}\n{\"action\": \"guess\", \"atoms\": [[row,col], [row,col], [row,col], [row,col]], \"reasoning\": \"...\"}\n\nWhen you think you know where all 4 balls are, make your guess.",

Find exactly 4 hidden atoms in an 8x8 grid by firing rays.\n\nGRID: 8x8, rows 1-8 (top to bottom), columns 1-8 (left to right).\nRAYS: Fire from edge positions (north/south: columns 1-8, east/west: rows 1-8).\n\nIMPORTANT: You cannot fire a ray from any position that has already been used as an entry or exit point.\n\n=== RAY BEHAVIOR RULES ===\n\nAll directions use the fixed board frame: NORTH (up/row-decreasing), SOUTH (down/row-increasing), EAST (right/col-increasing), WEST (left/col-decreasing).\n\nA ray starts OUTSIDE the grid at the edge position it was fired from. It then attempts to enter the grid cell by cell.\n\nENTRY CHECK (before entering the first cell):\n- If there is an atom in the entry cell → ABSORBED (H)\n- If there is an atom in either cell adjacent to the entry cell along the edge → REFLECTED (R) - ray never enters, exits at entry point\n- Otherwise, enter the first cell\n\nSUBSEQUENT CELLS (before entering each following cell), check in this order:\n\n1. Is there an atom in the cell the ray is about to enter? → ABSORBED (H) - ray stops\n\n2. Check the two cells perpendicular to the ray's path, adjacent to the cell the ray is about to enter:\n   - Atoms on BOTH sides → REFLECT (reverse direction)\n   - Atom on ONE side only → DEFLECT 90° away from the atom (the ray turns to travel in the direction opposite to where the atom is)\n   \n   DEFLECTION BY RAY DIRECTION (all directions are board compass directions):\n   - Ray traveling SOUTH: atom to EAST of next cell → turn to travel WEST; atom to WEST → turn EAST\n   - Ray traveling NORTH: atom to EAST of next cell → turn to travel WEST; atom to WEST → turn EAST\n   - Ray traveling EAST: atom to NORTH of next cell → turn to travel SOUTH; atom to SOUTH → turn NORTH\n   - Ray traveling WEST: atom to NORTH of next cell → turn to travel SOUTH; atom to SOUTH → turn NORTH\n   \n3. If none of the above, enter the next cell and continue.\n\n4. If the ray exits the grid boundaries, report the exit position.\n\n=== COMMON REASONING ERROR - AVOID THIS ===\n\nWRONG: \"NORTH-4 exits at EAST-7, so there MUST be an atom at (row 8, column 3)\"\n\nThis is WRONG because:\n- The exit position tells you where the ray LEFT the grid, nothing more\n- The most parsimonious explanation (single atom) for NORTH-4 → EAST-7 is an atom at (row 8, column 3)\n- The same pattern could also be caused by 3 atoms in a specific arrangement\n- In most cases, you cannot deduce atom positions from a single deflected ray\n\n=== CRITICAL DEDUCTION RULES ===\n\nMOST OBSERVATIONS ARE AMBIGUOUS ALONE - you must triangulate with multiple rays.\n\nABSORBED (H) - AMBIGUOUS:\n- The ray hit an atom somewhere, but may have deflected multiple times first\n- In most cases, you CANNOT assume the atom is in the entry row/column\n- Example: NORTH-3 absorbed does NOT mean atom is in column 3\n\nSTRAIGHT PASS-THROUGH (opposite entry/exit, same position) - AMBIGUOUS:\n- Most likely means clear path with no nearby atoms\n- BUT could result from symmetric deflections canceling out\n- Don't over-rely on this observation\n\nREFLECTION (R) - ALSO AMBIGUOUS:\n- An \"R\" result means entry position equals exit position\n- This could be immediate reflection (atom diagonally adjacent to entry cell)\n- OR a complex path that happens to return to the entry point\n- Only corner positions (1 and 8) are guaranteed to be immediate reflections\n- Most single observations in this game are ambiguous\n\n90° EXIT (different side, perpendicular) - VERY AMBIGUOUS:\n- At least one deflection occurred, possibly many\n- The ray may have zigzagged across the grid\n- Use additional rays to triangulate\n\nOFFSET EXIT (opposite side, different position) - AMBIGUOUS:\n- Multiple deflections occurred\n- Hard to interpret without additional rays\n\n=== STRATEGY ===\n1. Most single observations are ambiguous - nearly every deduction requires triangulation\n2. Use multiple rays to constrain possibilities\n3. Look for patterns across multiple observations\n4. Cross-reference ALL observations - proposed atoms must explain every ray's behavior\n5. Before guessing, mentally verify: would these 4 atoms produce all observed ray behaviors?\n6. Accept uncertainty - this is a constraint satisfaction problem, not simple deduction\n\n=== SCORING ===\nYour goal is to MINIMIZE your score. Lower is better.\n- Each ray entry point costs 1 point\n- Each ray exit point costs 1 point (detours cost 2, reflections cost 1, absorptions cost 1)\n- Each missed atom costs 5 points\n\nBalance information gathering against point cost.

      "playPrompt": "You are playing Black Box, a game of hide and seek played on an 8 by 8 grid (the Black Box).\n\nYour opponent has hidden 4 balls within this box. By shooting rays into the box and observing where they emerge, it is possible to deduce the positions of the hidden balls.\n\nGRID: 8x8, rows 1-8 (top to bottom), columns 1-8 (left to right).\nRAYS: Fire from edge positions - NORTH/SOUTH use columns 1-8, EAST/WEST use rows 1-8.\n\nThere are three possible outcomes for each ray you send into the box:\n\nDETOUR: The ray is deflected and emerges somewhere other than where you sent it in. Detours are denoted by matching pairs of numbers -- one where the ray went in, and the other where it came out.\n\nREFLECTION (R): The ray is reflected and emerges in the same place it was sent in.\n\nHIT (H): The ray strikes a ball directly and is absorbed. It does not emerge from the box.\n\nThe rules for how balls deflect rays are simple and are best shown by example.\n\nAs a ray approaches a ball it is deflected ninety degrees. Rays can be deflected multiple times. In the diagrams below, the dashes represent empty box locations and the letter O represents a ball. The entrance and exit points of each ray are marked with numbers. Note that the entrance and exit points are always interchangeable. * denotes the path taken by the ray.\n\nNote carefully the relative positions of the ball and the ninety degree deflection it causes.\n\n    1                                            \n  - * - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -       \n  - * - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -       \n1 * * - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -         - O - - - - O -       \n  - - O - - - - -         - - O - - - - -         - - * * * * - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * * * * * 2     3 * * * - - * - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -         - - - O - * - -      \n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -         - - - - * * - -       \n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -         - - - - * - O -       \n                                2                         3\n\nA reflection occurs when a ray emerges from the same point it was sent in. This can happen in several ways:\n\n                                                                           \n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - O - - -         - - O - O - - -          - - - - - - - -\nR * * * * - - - -         - - - * - - - -          O - - - - - - -\n  - - - - O - - -         - - - * - - - -        R - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -       R * * * * - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - - - - - -\n\nIn the first example, the ray is deflected downwards by the upper ball, then left by the lower ball, and finally retraces its path to its point of origin. The second example is similar. The third example is a bit anomalous but can be rationalized by realizing the ray never gets a chance to get into the box. Alternatively, the ray can be thought of as being deflected downwards and immediately emerging from the box.\n\nA hit occurs when a ray runs straight into a ball:\n\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - O - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -        H * * * * - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -       H * * * * O - - -          - - - * - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - O - - - -\nH * * * O - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -\n\nBe sure to compare the second example of a hit with the first example of a reflection.\n\nImportant: A hit takes priority over a reflection. If a ball is in the entry cell, the ray is absorbed even if there are also balls diagonally adjacent that would otherwise cause a reflection:\n\n  O - - - - - - -\nH O - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n  - - - - - - - -\n\nIn this example, even though there is a ball at row 1 that would normally cause an edge reflection, the ball at row 2 absorbs the ray first.\n\nSCORING:\nYour goal is to minimize your score. Lower is better.\n- Each ray entry point costs 1 point\n- Each ray exit point costs 1 point (detours cost 2 total, reflections cost 1, absorptions cost 1)\n- Each missed atom costs 5 points\n\nStrategy: Use as few rays as possible while still finding all 4 atoms.\n\nRULES:\n- You cannot fire from positions already used as entry or exit points.\n- Maximum 20 rays.\n\nRespond with JSON only:\n{\"action\": \"fire\", \"side\": \"north|south|east|west\", \"position\": 1-8, \"reasoning\": \"...\"}\n{\"action\": \"guess\", \"atoms\": [[row,col], [row,col], [row,col], [row,col]], \"reasoning\": \"...\"}\n\nWhen you think you know where all 4 balls are, make your guess.",
